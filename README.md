# ODE Euler Method
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Euler Method, a numerical approach for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Developed as part of the Introduction to Numerical Simulation (2022) course, it serves as a demonstration of the method's application in computational mathematics.
The Euler Method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving initial value problems in ODEs. It approximates the solution by discretizing the equation into steps and iteratively calculating the solution at each step.
